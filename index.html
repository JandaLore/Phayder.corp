						<h3 class="ourfont">General information</h3>
						<p>Social Structure: The Phayder created the substance known as Nanoblack to create the super soldiers known as the Necris, but the substance and the resultant Necris Process would have a significant impact on the social order on Omicron 6. Those who have undergone the Phayder's Necris process typically end up with a strong religious connection to the Nanoblack, and while this was not at all intended by the Phayder to begin with, they have since aligned themselves with the Necris' religious doctrines. The Necris are gradually taking full control over Omicron 6, and it is suspected that eventually the entire population of the planet will have undergone the Necris Process.</p>
						<p>The Necris, and thereby the Phayder, believe that they are bringing "salvation" to the universe, by giving others "purpose" through death. They consider life to be a weakness and are grateful to the Nanoblack and the Necris Process for their present state of being.</p>
						<p>It is conceivable, though only a theory, that the religious goals of the Necris are the expression of the underlying base desires of the Nanoblack itself to propagate and spread.</p>
						<h3 class="ourfont">Fallen Earth Fan Fic</h3>
						<p>A squad of elite soldiers was ordered to go to space hopper, to travel to uncharted worlds and opening up new markets and distribution of Nanoblack. The instability of hopper led to the fact that the squad has lost equipment. They were on an unknown plane, which was affected by the global cataclysm, the soldiers had to fight for survival. The new social structure absorbed soldiers, eventually they joined Lightbearers - one of the factions in this world. Lost contact with Omicron, a former elite squad decides to create own clan, named it in a name of former owners - Phayder Corp.</p>
