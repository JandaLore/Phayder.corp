				</div>	
				<h3 class="ourfont">General rules</h3>
				<p>1. Do not insult other players.</p>
				<p>2. If you have access to clan vault - you can give everything you want to share or take what you need, so be carefull with putting something there.</p>
				<h3 class="ourfont">World PVP</h3>
				<p><b>Our main goal is friendly PVP!</b></p>
				<p>1. Faction is important for us. This means, in fields of war you should probably fight vs own clan.</p>
				<div class="notes">
					<p><b>Why is this rule exist?</b></p>
					<p>Killing own faction is unfair to the new players. Thats why faction is in priority. So these new players wont be confused by being killed by same faction.</p>
					<p><b>Who will be my allies then?</b></p>
					<p>Your allies in the first place, group a): your faction, allied faction (with exceptions), mono-faction clans, cross-faction clans(lbs/enfos, techs/travs, chotas/vistas).</p>
					<p>On the other hand, a large number of players with multy-factioned toons, as well as omni clans generates events when players of your faction will be hostile. Therefore, when choosing as allies omni clans beware. That is why the omni clans recommended as group b)</p>
				</div>
				<p>2. Killing players from group a) is not advisable and can be punished.</p>
				<p>3. Respect your enemies. Doesnt matter which clan, faction was defeated player - your digninty and honor is more important.</p>
				<h3 class="ourfont">Blood sports (BS)</h3>
				<p>1. Play objective of the current game type.</p>
				<div class="notes">
				<p><b>Why cant I do what I want to?</b></p>
				<p>Some players are grinding DT, others just enjoying playing BS, when you are dueling in Assault it makes match unbalanced and this is unfair to your team.</p>
				</div>
				<p>2. Don't spoil the game because of personal sympathy or hatred</p>
